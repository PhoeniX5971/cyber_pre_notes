> Keep in mind that those notes were done by me, and i am in no way a professional in cyber security, and just like everyone else, i make mistakes, if anything is wrong in any of the files in this repo please contact me to fix them. I posted those notes to my github for easy version control, and easier way of sharing the files with other students.  Those notes were written in obsidian and use obsidian's linking feature, which i do recommend using, however you can use any markdown previewer to view the notes properly, you will just have to do the navigation to other files yourself.
